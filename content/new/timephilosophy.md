Before we dive into how or why Mobius does certain things, I'd like to share some general
thoughts thoughts about how I would like to start thinking about time.

There are two time-sensitive concepts in Mobius that are related, but are not the same: *Quantization* and *Synchronized Recording*.

Quantization is what determines when something will happen.  It is the selection of a *moment* in time when an action will occur.

Synchronized Recording is the process of creating a recording whose length is controlled.  It is the selection of a *span* of time. 

These two concepts can be thought of more generally as *points* and *units*.

A *point* is a moment in time and a *unit* is a length of time.  

#### Units

In music, there are a few standard time units, the ones that are the most useful
within Mobius are the *beat* and the *measure*.
