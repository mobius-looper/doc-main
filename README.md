## Mobius 3 Documentation

This repository contains the primary documentation for Mobius 3.
Secondary repositories are being created for the scripting environment and
a reference manual for parameters and functions.

It publishes a site using GitHub Pages at https://mobius-looper.github.io/doc-main

The site uses Hugo with the Relearn theme.  You are welcome to contribute documentation
provided you conform to the structure required by Relearn.  Unless you are familar with Github
Pages, Hugo, and Relearn, it is best if you email me your contributions and I will convert them
into Relearn chapters.
